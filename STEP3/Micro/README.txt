Grading_Script.sh:
	1: Your grading shell script cannot open other shell script files
	   so to run it with .jar file use this Grading_Script.sh
	   
	   Instead of line: ./Micro $i > usertest/$output
	   Use:			  : java -jar Micro.jar $i > usertest/$output
	   
	#!/bin/sh

	INPUTS=inputs/*
	mkdir usertest
	for i in $INPUTS
		do
			filename=${i%.*}
			name=${filename##*/}
			echo "Testing input file $i"
			output="${name}Test.out"
			outtest="${name}.out"
			java -jar Micro.jar $i > usertest/$output
			diff -B -b -s usertest/$output outputs/$outtest
		done

How to run Micro.jar in Windows/Linux:
	1: java -jar Micro.jar file_name.micro
	2: file_name.micro must be in the same directory

How to run shell script Micro.sh in Linux:
	1: ./Micro.sh file_name.micro
	2: file_name.micro must be in the same directory
	3: This shell script just run Micro.jar and takes argument from the command line,
	   it will not compile java classes
	   
	--- IF YOU WANT TO COMPILE IT ---
	java org.antlr.v4.Tool MicroGrammar.g4
	javac MicroGrammar*.java
	javac CustomToken.java
	javac MicroParser.java
	javac DriverSymbolTable.java
	javac MicroListener.java
	javac MicroSymbolTable.java
	javac Driver.java
	
	--- AFTER RUN ---
	java Driver file_name.micro
	
Submission structure:
	1: Driver.java is the Driver class;
	2: CustomToken.java is additional class that must be 
	   included to the project, just in case if you want 
	   to compile on your computer;
	3: MicroParser.java is the Parser that must be 
	   included to the project, just in case if you want 
	   to compile on your computer;
	4: MicroGrammar.g4 is ANTLR4 grammar file for the Micro language;
	5: DriverSymbolTable.java 
	6: MicroListener.java 
	7: MicroSymbolTable.java 
	8: Micro.jar is the Java executable program;
	   8.1: Micro.jar includes Driver.java, CustomToken.java, MicroParser.java,
	        MicroGrammar.g4, DriverSymbolTable.java, MicroListener.java,
			MicroSymbolTable.java, and
	        all files which were generated by ANTLR tool;
